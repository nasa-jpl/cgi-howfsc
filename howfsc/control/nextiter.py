    Compute expected mean total contrast for next iteration, or optionally a
    a different metric (for use in selecting camera settings)

    This computation takes in the (measured - prev model estimate) for each
    wavelength, and adds the new model estimate to it.  (This should also
    capture any nonlinearities incorporated into the model.)

    This function will evaluate contrast over the pixels in the dark hole
    which are not included in the fixed bad pixel map and which are not
    flagged as bad electric-field estimates in the measured data.  (Bad
    electric-field estimates will appear as NaNs in destlist.)

    Arguments:
     cfg: CoronagraphMode object
     dmlist: list of ndarrays, of the same size as the arrays expected by
      cfg.dmlist objects. These are DM voltages.  This should have the same
      number of DMs as the model.
     croplist: list of 4-tuples of (lower row, lower col,
      number of rows, number of columns), indicating where in a clean frame
      each PSF is taken.  All are integers; the first two must be >= 0 and the
      second two must be > 0.  This should have the same number of elements as
      the model has wavelengths.
     fixedbp: this is a fixed bad pixel map for a clean frame, and will be a 2D
      boolean array with the same size as a cleaned frame.
     n2clist: list of 2D floating-point arrays giving the scale factor to
      convert from normalized intensity to contrast as a multiplier.  These
      correspond to the relative drop-off in flux from unity due to the
      presence of nearby coronagraphic masks.

      As an example, if the measured normalized intensity is 5e-9, but the
      presence of a mask edge is causing the flux to drop to 0.5x of usual,
      then the value in an array of n2clist will be 2, and the actual contrast
      will be 1e-8.

      Elements of n2clist must be at least as large as the number of rows and
      columns in a cropped region (elements 2 and 3 of each croplist tuple) to
      ensure that every valid pixel has a conversion factor to contrast.  This
      should have the same number of elements as the model has wavelengths.
     destlist: complex-valued 2D array of the same shape as
      cfg.sl_list[lind].dh.e for each lind (wavelength) in the CoronagraphMode.
      These will be (measured - previous-model).

    Keyword Arguments:
     cleanrow: Number of rows in a clean frame.  Integer > 0.  Defaults to
      1024, the number of active area rows on the EXCAM detector; under nominal
      conditions, there should be no reason to use anything else.
     cleancol: Number of columns in clean frame. Integer > 0.  Defaults to
      1024, the number of active area cols on the EXCAM detector; under nominal
      conditions, there should be no reason to use anything else.
     method: string containing one of the names in valid_method_list. Currently
      only 'mean' and 'percentile' are supported.  mean will return the mean
      over all good pixels, and is the default.
     percentile: Float between 0 and 100 inclusive, indicating which percentile
      of flux across all good pixels to return.  50 is the median over all good
      pixels, and is the default.  This argument is unused if the 'method'
      keyword argument is not 'percentile'.
     index_list: list of integer indices, or None, indicating which of the
      wavelengths in cfg will be used for the calculation.  If None, all
      wavelengths will be used.

    Returns:
     a single scalar contrast value

    Utility function to estimate how long a iteration is expected to take

    This function is a broad parametric estimate, to be provided to SSC to
    determine whether to continue iterating HOWFSC.

    Note: this estimator might be revisited and refined once the iteration
    procedure is better known, if some better degree of accuracy is necessary.

    This function assumes that each element of exptime and of nframes with the
    same index are associated with the same exposure.

    total time is:
     fixed overhead + ndm*(overhead per DM) + nfilt*(overhead per filter)
     + ndm*nfilt*(overhead per combo) + elementwise_sum([exposure time +
      overhead per frame]*[number of frames])

    Arguments:
     ndm: number of total DM positions to use in an iteration. Generally will
      be odd (e.g. one unprobed, 6 probes implemented as 3 pairs for 7 total).
      In any event, must be an integer > 0.
     nfilt: number of total CFAM filters to use in an iteration. Generally will
      be 3 (NFOV, WFOV) or 5 (SPEC).  In any event, must be an integer > 0.
     exptime: 1D array with a list of floating point values > 0.  These are
      exposure times at each DM setting/CFAM filter setting combination.  Must
      be length ndm*nfilt.  Units of seconds.
     nframes: 1D array with a list of integer values > 0.  There are the
      numbers of frames to be collected at each DM setting/CFAM filter setting
      combination.  Must be length ndm*nfilt.
     overdm: overhead associated with a DM move, such as the time to command
      DME1.  Must be a floating-point scalar >= 0.  Units of seconds.
     overfilt: overhead associated with a CFAM filter move, such as the time
      to translate CFAM.  Must be a floating-point scalar >= 0.  Units of
      seconds.
     overboth: overhead associated with each DM setting/CFAM filter setting
      combination, such as the time to apply new camera settings.  Must be a
      floating-point scalar >= 0.  Units of seconds.  This should *not* include
      any times already covered by overdm or overfilt, or else they will be
      double-counted.
     overfixed: fixed overhead time for doing an iteration, for tasks such as
      setting DM2.  Must be a floating-point scalar >= 0.  Units of seconds.
     overframe: overhead per individual frame for readout.  Must be a floating-
      point scalar >= 0.  Units of seconds.

    Scale factors scale the DM's probe commands linearly, and the probe
    intensity contributes quadratically.
