        class object definition for implementing DM crosstalk. DM crosstalk
        is defined by:

                          + crosstalk[i, j] * dm_command[i-irow, j-jcol]
        (Equation 1)
        
        Arguments:
         yaml_fn: path+filename of yaml file with crosstalk data

         list_xtalk_arrays: a list of nact x nact arrays representing DM
          crosstalk, requires list_off_row_col of same length

         list_off_row_col: a list of [irow, jcol] actuator offset for applying
           xtalk, not used if list_xtalk_arrays is None

         list_array_roll: a list of [roll_row, roll_col] to be applied to the 
           xtalk_arrays before creating the sparse matrix. Without this roll, the
           application of crosstalk is as defined in Equation 1 above. If array_roll is defined,
                dm_actual[i, j] = dm_command[i, j]
                          + crosstalk[i-roll_row, j-roll_col] * dm_command[i-irow, j-jcol]
           (Equation 2)
           
           roll is not used if list_xtalk_arrays is None

         list_flip_x: a list of bool, same length as list_xtalk_arrays. If True,
           then the xtalk_array is flip-X (columns) before inserted in the Crosstalk
           object sparse matrix. Order is: flip-x then roll (if any).
           not used if list_xtalk_arrays is None

         if no inputs, a crosstalk object of identity (no crosstalk) is created

         create a Cdm_crosstalk object by either reading from the yaml_fn
         and/or loading from a list_xtalk_array with list_off_row_col offsets.
         If both a yaml_fn and the list of xtalk arrays are input, then an
         object will be constructed aggregating both the data from the yaml and
         the arrays.

def apply_roll_flip(list_xtalk_arrays, list_array_roll=None, list_flip_x=None):
    """
    Before adding an array (nact x nact) of coupling coefficients to the sparse
    crosstalk array, it might be necessary to shift (roll) the array and/or flip-x
    (A(x,y) => A(-x,y)) to match the conventions and the location of the DM mirror.

    The convention used in the CDCCrosstalk class is
                dm_actual[i, j] = dm_command[i, j]
                          + crosstalk[i, j] * dm_command[i-irow, j-jcol]

    If, for example, the crosstalk coefficients were determined using the convention:
            dm_actual[i, j] = dm_command[i, j]
                          + crosstalk[i-irow, j-jcol] * dm_command[i-irow, j-jcol]
    then the crosstalk array must translated (np.roll) by (irow, jcol) before adding
    to the CDMCrosstalk object.

    If the crosstalk coefficient array was determined using an "unfolded" optical
    model, but the physical DM is in a mirror-flipped position, then the crosstalk
    coefficient array must be mirrored, i.e. flip-x, before adding the the CDMCrosstalk
    object.

    This routine is a convenient utility for applying any necessary shift or flip-x
    to conform to the CDMCrosstalk convention. It is incorporated in 
    dm_crosstalk_fits_to_yaml() for creating a dm_crosstalk yaml, or it can be called
    separately.

    Order is: flip-x then roll (if any).

    Arguments:
     list_xtalk_arrays: list of numpy arrays of shape (nact, nact)

     list_array_roll: list of numpy arrays or lists of length 2. Each roll array is
       [row, col], and used directly in np.roll(A, rollij, axis=(0,1)), where A is a
       xtalk array and rollij is a [row, col]. Default=None (do nothing).

     list_flip_x: list of bool, True => A = fliplr(A), False => do nothing.
       Default=None (do nothing).
