    Utility function which will evaluate a HOWFSC optical model definiton file

     fn: string containing path to a filename with a HOWFSC optical model YAML
      file

    Keyword Arguments:
     usefiles: boolean indicating whether to actually load files (True) or

      the assumption that the primary use case is to validate the spec and file
      checkout is outside the spec.

    Returns:
     True if meets spec, False if does not meet spec, None if could not be
